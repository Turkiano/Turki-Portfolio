              My career in visual storytelling began as a VFX artist during a
              three-month internship at PixelPost Agency in Malaysia, a renowned
              MSC-status company in the advertising industry. There, I honed my
              skills in digital imaging, 2D and 3D animation, and video editing,
              laying the creative foundation for what was to come. Returning to
              my hometown, Jeddah, I stepped into my first full-time role with
              Milimeter Production as an Assistant Manager. This role opened
              doors to high-profile projects, including visually captivating
              work for Red Bull and other notable productions, sharpening both
              my technical and managerial abilities. Simultaneously, I embraced
              freelancing, notably collaborating with Queen Lounge on an
              exclusive event featuring Alaa Almonsory from Alf Alf FM. From
              conceptualization to shooting and editing, I led the production
              process, delivering a final piece that exceeded expectations and
              left the client highly satisfied. This journey reflects my passion
              for visual media, adaptability across roles, and dedication to
              delivering excellence at every stage.
